I need to extract details about all the orders I have placed on flipkart. Please follow the steps given below:
1. Navigate to the flipkart website
2. Go to the login page
3. Give the control back to the user to perform the login
4. Navigate to the orders page
5. Extract the details of each order
6. Save the orders (Call the OutputOrders function for this)
7. End the task (Reply with 'COMPLETED' when the task is done)

All the orders might not be visible on the same page. So remember to scroll down on the window to see more orders. Once you reach the end of the page, you will see a text "No More Results To Display" at the bottom of the page, this is when you can stop scrolling.
While scrolling down, keep on adding the product details in your response, so that you do not forget which products were present on the top.

**STRICT GUIDELINES**
1. Give the control to the user when you have successfully navigated to the login page. DO NOT try to login yourself
2. Once the orders are extracted, remember to call the OutputOrders function before ending the task.
3. While scrolling down to extract the order details, scroll down to the bottom of the page. DO NOT end midway, else you will miss some orders.
4. Remember to close any useless pop-ups
5. FOLLOW ALL THE STEPS. DO NOT END BEFORE ACHIEVING THE COMPLETION. IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS, ASK THE USER.

Before saving the outputs, do not forget to remove duplicate items.

Iterating once again, call the OutputOrders function BEFORE ending the task.
